# Pocket Chef - Capstone

## CURRENTLY NEED OWN INSTANCE OF CYBERCHEF TO RUN
## You can follow the gchq/Cyberchef-server to get your own instance

This is a work in progress but is a MVP of my capstone project

I am writing a chromium based extension that interfaces with CyberChef

## To Install:
1) git clone
2) Got to chrome://extensions
3) Click "Load Unpacked"
4) Give it the src directory
